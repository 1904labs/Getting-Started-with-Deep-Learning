Getting Started with Deep Learning  

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks to accompany the STL Big Data Meetup presentation on Aug 7 2019.  

The Google slides can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Gq9tk3f8Mw9nos8zuzjc9kbxzVZQ_mJo1VxUwnB7h48/edit?usp=sharing).  

# To run notebooks, you need a number of python libraries. 
Option 1: Create a virtual env with python 3.6 and the dependencies in `requirements.txt`  
Option 2: Build and run the included Dockerfile. *coming soon - check back for updates*
