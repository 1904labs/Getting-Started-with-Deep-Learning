Getting Started with Deep Learning  

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks to accompany the STL Big Data Meetup presentation on Aug 7, 2019 and the STL Python Meetup presentation on Sep 18, 2019.

The Google slides can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Gq9tk3f8Mw9nos8zuzjc9kbxzVZQ_mJo1VxUwnB7h48/edit?usp=sharing).  

# To run notebooks, you need a number of python libraries. 
Option 1: Create a virtual env with python 3.6 and the dependencies in `requirements.txt`  
Option 2: Build and run the included Dockerfile. Note: Be sure to mount a volume when running the Docker image so that your work is saved to your local drive.
